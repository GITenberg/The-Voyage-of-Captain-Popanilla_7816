There is an island in the Indian Ocean, so unfortunate as not yet to have been visited either by Discovery Ships or Missionary Societies.  It is a place where all those things are constantly found which men most desire to see, and with the sight of which 
t
hey are seldom favoured.  It abounds in flowers, and fruit, and sunshine.  Lofty mountains, covered with green and mighty forests, except where the red rocks catch the fierce beams of the blazing sun, bowery valleys, broad lakes, gigantic trees, and gushi
n
g rivers bursting from rocky gorges, are crowned with a purple and ever cloudless sky.  Summer, in its most unctuous state and most mellow majesty, is here perpetual.  So intense and overpowering, in the daytime, is the rich union of heat and perfume, tha
t living animal or creature is never visible; and were you and I to pluck, before sunset, the huge fruit from yonder teeming tree, we might fancy ourselves for the moment the future sinners of another Eden.  Yet a solitude it is not.

 intimation of animal existence in this seeming solitude is given, by the appearance of mermaids; who, floating on the rosy sea, congregate about these rocks.  They sound a loud but melodious chorus from their sea-shells, and a faint and distant chorus so
o
n answers from the island.  The mermaidens immediately repeat their salutations, and are greeted with a nearer and a louder answer.  As the red and rayless sun drops into the glowing waters, the choruses simultaneously join; and rushing from the woods, an
d down the mountain steeps to the nearest shore, crowds of human beings, at the same moment, appear and collect.

 extremely pleasant to dance and sing, to crown themselves with chaplets, and to drink wine; but he was 'free to confess' that he did not imagine that the most barefaced hireling of corruption could for a moment presume to maintain that there was any util

ence which they style simplicity of manners, and who are perpetually committing the blunder of supposing that every advance towards perfection only withdraws man further from his primitive and proper condition, Popanilla triumphantly demonstrated that no 
s
uch order as that which they associated with the phrase 'state of nature' ever existed.  'Man,' said he, 'is called the masterpiece of nature; and man is also, as we all know, the most curious of machines; now, a machine is a work of art, consequently, th
e
 masterpiece of nature is the masterpiece of art.  The object of all mechanism is the attainment of utility; the object of man, who is the most perfect machine, is utility in the highest degree.  Can we believe, therefore, that this machine was ever inten
d
ed for a state which never could have called forth its powers, a state in which no utility could ever have been attained, a state in which there are no wants; consequently, no demand; consequently, no supply; consequently, no competition; consequently, no
 
invention; consequently, no profits; only one great pernicious monopoly of comfort and ease?  Society without wants is like a world without winds.  It is quite clear, therefore, that there is no such thing as Nature; Nature is Art, or Art is Nature; that 
which is most useful is most natural, because utility is the test of nature; therefore a steam-engine is in fact a much more natural production than a mountain. }{\b\f1\fs24\cf6\cgrid0 *}{\f1\cgrid0

 of the Isle of Fantaisie was a total want of development.  This he observed with equal sorrow and surprise; he respected the wisdom
 of their ancestors; at the same time, no one could deny that they were both barbarous and ignorant; he highly esteemed also the constitution, but regretted that it was not in the slightest degree adapted to the existing want of society: he was not for de
s
troying any establishments, but, on the contrary, was for courteously affording them the opportunity of self-dissolution.  He finished by re-urging, in strong terms, the immediate development of the island.  In the first place, a great metropolis must be 
i
nstantly built, because a great metropolis always produces a great demand; and, moreover, Popanilla had some legal doubts whether a country without a capital could in fact be considered a State.  Apologising for having so long trespassed upon the attentio
n of the assembly, he begged distinctly to state }{\b\f1\fs24\cf6\cgrid0 **}{\f1\cgrid0 
 that he had no wish to see his Majesty and his fellow-subjects adopt these new principles without examination and without experience.  They might commence on a small scale; let them cut down their forests,
 and by turning them into ships and houses discover the utility of timber; let the whole island be dug up; let canals be cut, docks be built, and all the elephants be killed directly, that their teeth might yield an immediate article for exportation.  A s

w
ards, had been discovered to be truth.  He did not forget that in still further centuries the lately recognised truth had been re-discovered to be falsehood; but then these men were not less illustrious; and what wonder that their opinions were really err

neous, since they were not his present ones?  The reasoning was equally conclusive and consolatory.  Popanilla, therefore, was not discouraged; and although he deemed it more prudent not to go out of his way to seek another audience of his sovereign, or t

o
f our international relations, the commercial interest of this island will be incapable of furnishing the taxes which I intend to levy, I have determined, therefore, to fit out an expedition for the purpose of discovering new islands and forming relations
 
with new islanders.  It is but due to your merit that you should be appointed to the command of it; and further to testify my infinite esteem for your character, and my complete confidence in your abilities, I make you post-captain on the spot.  As the ax
i
om of your school seems to be that everything can be made perfect at once, without time, without experience, without practice, and without preparation, I have no doubt, with the aid of a treatise or two, You will make a consummate naval commander, althoug

inconceivable rapidity to the shore.  His pupils, who would have fled to his rescue, were stifled with the embraces of their former partners, and their utilitarianism dissolved in the arms of those they once so rudely rejected.  As for their tutor, he was
 
thrust into one of the canoes, with some fresh water, bread-fruit, dried fish, and a basket of alligator-pears.  A band of mermaids carried the canoe with exquisite management through the shallows and over the breakers, and poor Popanilla in a few minutes
 
found himself out at sea.  Tremendously frightened, he offered to recant all his opinions, and denounce as traitors any individuals whom the Court might select.  But his former companions did not exactly detect the utility of his return.  His offers, his 
supplications, were equally fruitless; and the only answer which floated to him on the wind was, 'Farewell, Captain Popanilla!'

were at last ushered into an apartment of smaller size, but of more elegant character.  A personage of prepossessing appearance was lolling on a couch of an appearance equally prepossessing.  Before him, on a table, were some papers, exquisite fruits, and
 
some liqueurs.  Popanilla was presented, and received with fascinating complaisance.  His friend stated the object of their visit, and handed the sackful of gold to the gentleman on the sofa.  The gentleman on the sofa ordered a couple of attendants to as
c
ertain its contents.  While this computation was going on he amused his guests by his lively conversation, and charmed Popanilla by his polished manners and easy civility.  He offered him, during his stay in Vraibleusia, the use of a couple of equipages, 
a
 villa, and an opera-box; insisted upon sending to his hotel some pine-apples and some rare wine, and gave him a perpetual ticket to his picture-gallery.  When his attendants had concluded their calculation, he ordered them to place Popanilla's precious m

tal in his treasury; and then, presenting the Captain with a small packet of pink shells, he kindly inquired whether he could be of any further use to him.  Popanilla was loth to retire without his gold, of the utility of which, in spite of the convenienc

 of competition, he seemed to possess an instinctive conception; but as his friend rose and withdrew, he could do nothing less than accompany him; for, having now known him nearly half a day, his confidence in his honour and integrity was naturally unboun

s
 his agricultural science that the vulgar only accounted for his admirable produce by a miraculous fecundity!  The proprietor of these hundred golden acres was a rather mysterious sort of personage.  He was an aboriginal inhabitant, and, though the only o

ally described by such panegyrical periphrases as 'soul of the country,' 'foundation of the State,' 'the only real, and true, and substantial being;' while, on the other hand, those who presumed to differ from those sentiments were in the habit of styling
 
him 'the dead weight,' 'the vampire,' 'the night-mare,' and other titles equally complimentary.  They also maintained that, instead of being either real or substantial, he was, in fact, the most flimsy and fictitious personage in the whole island; and the

 of him.  They grumbled, but he growled; he swore that it was the constitution of the country; that there was an uninterrupted line of precedents to confirm the claim; and that, if they did not approve of the arrangement, they and their fathers should not
 
have elected to have settled, or presumed to have been spawned, upon his island.  Then, as if he were not desirous of resting his claim on its mere legal merits, he would remind them of the superiority of his grain, and the impossibility of a scarcity, in
 
the event of which calamity an insular people could always find a plentiful though temporary resource in sea-weed.  He then clearly proved to them that, if ever they had the imprudence to change any of their old laws, they would necessarily never have mor

 than one meal a day as long as they lived.  Finally, he recalled to their recollection that he had made the island what it was, that he was their mainstay, and that his counsel and exertions had rendered them the wonder of the world.  Thus, between force
, and fear, and flattery, the Vraibleusians paid for their corn nearly its weight in gold; but what did that signify to a nation with so many pink shells!

was waited upon by the most eminent bookseller in Hubbabub, who begged to have the honour of introducing to the public a Narrative of Captain Popanilla's Voyage.  This gentleman assured Popanilla that the Vraibleusian public were nervously alive to anythi
n

hingly informed the mercantile M\'e6
cenas that he did not know how to write.  The publisher told him that this circumstance was not of the slightest importance; that he had never for a moment supposed that so sublime a savage could possess such a vulgar accomp
lishment; and that it was by no means difficult for a man to publish his travels without writing a line of them.

t
hing was not useless; from which it was clear that Utility was Providence.  After drinking some capital wine, the intelligent individual told Popanilla that he was wrong in supposing Fantaisie to be an island; that, on the contrary, it was a great contine

t; that this was proved by the probable action of the tides in the part of the island which had not yet been visited; that the consequence of these tides would be that, in the course of a season or two, Fantaisie would become a great receptacle for iceber
g
s, and be turned into the North Pole; that, therefore, the seasons throughout the world would be changed; that this year, in Vraibleusia, the usual winter would be omitted, and that when the present summer was finished the dog-days would again commence.

\faauto\ls12\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\f1\cgrid0 Owing to the competition which existed between the publishers, the printers, and the engravers of the city of Hubbabub, and the great exertio
ns of the intelligent individual, the Narrative of Captain Popanilla's Voyage was brought out in less than a week, and was immediately in everybody's hand.  The work contained a detailed account of everything which took place daring the whole of the three
 
days, and formed a quarto volume.  The plates were numerous and highly interesting, There was a line engraving of Alligator Mountain and a mezzotint of Seaweed Island; a view of the canoe N.E.; a view of the canoe N.W.; a view of the canoe S.E.; a view of
 the canoe S.W.  There were highly-finished coloured drawings of the dried fish and the breadfruit, and an exquisitely tinted representation of the latter in a mouldy state.  But the }{\i\f1\cgrid0 chef-d'\'9cuvre}{\f1\cgrid0 
 was the portrait of the Author himself.  He was represented t
rampling on the body of a boa constrictor of the first quality, in the skin of which he was dressed; at his back were his bow and arrows; his right hand rested on an uprooted pine-tree; he stood in a desert between two volcanoes; at his feet was a lake of
 
magnitude; the distance lowered with an approaching tornado; but a lucky flash of lightning revealed the range of the Andes and both oceans.  Altogether he looked the most dandified of savages, and the most savage of dandies.  It was a sublime lithograph,
 
and produced scarcely less important effects upon Popanilla's fortune than that lucky 'lock of hair;' for no sooner was the portrait published than Popanilla received a ticket for the receptions of a lady of quality.  On showing it to Skindeep, he was tol
d
 that the honour was immense, and therefore he must go by all means.  Skindeep regretted that he could not accompany him, but he was engaged to a lecture on shoemaking; and a lecture was a thing he made it a point never to miss, because, as he very proper
l
y observed, 'By lectures you may become extremely well informed without any of the inconveniences of study.  No fixity of attention, no continuity of meditation, no habits of reflection, no aptitude of combination, are the least requisite; all which thing
s
 only give you a nervous headache; and yet you gain all the results of all these processes.  True it is that that which is so easily acquired is not always so easily remembered; but what of that?  Suppose you forget any subject, why then you go to another
 lecture.'  'Very true!' said Popanilla.

broke up, the principal philosophers immediately rushing to their clubs to ascertain the truth of this report.  Popanilla was unfashionable enough to make his acknowledgments to his hostess before he left her house.  As he gazed upon her ladyship's brilli

,
 after an hour's walk, his Excellency arrived.  At the extremity of the hall was a colossal and metallic Statue of extraordinary appearance.  It represented an armed monarch.  The head and bust were of gold, and the curling hair was crowned with an imperi
a
l diadem; the body and arms were of silver, worked in the semblance of a complete suit of enamelled armour of the feudal ages; and the thighs and legs were of iron, which the artist had clothed in the bandaged hose of the old Saxons.  The figure bore the 
a
ppearance of great antiquity, but had evidently been often repaired and renovated since its first formation.  The workmanship was clearly of different eras, and the reparations, either from ignorance or intention, had often been effected with little defer
e
nce to the original design.  Part of the shoulders had been supplied by the other, though less precious, metal, and the Roman and Imperial ornaments had unaccountably been succeeded by the less classic, though more picturesque, decorations of Gothic armou
r
.  On the other hand, a great portion of the chivalric and precious material of the body had been removed, and replaced by a style and substance resembling those of the lower limbs.  In its right hand the Statue brandished a naked sword, and with its left

Popanilla was informed that this extraordinary Statue enjoyed all the faculties of an intellectual being, with the additional advantage of some faculties which intellectual beings do not enjoy.  It possessed not only the faculty of speech, but of spea
king truth; not only the power of judgment, but of judging rightly; not only the habit of listening, but of listening attentively.  Its antiquity was so remote that the most profound and acute antiquarians had failed in tracing back its origin.  The Abori
g
inal Inhabitant, however, asserted that it was the work of one of his ancestors; and as his assertion was confirmed by all traditions, the allegation was received.  Whatever might have been its origin, certain it was that it was now immortal, for it could
 
never die; and to whomsoever it might have been originally indebted for its power, not less sure was it that it was now omnipotent, for it could do all things.  Thus alleged and thus believed the Vraibleusians, marvellous and sublime people! who, with all
 the impotence of mortality, have created a Government which is both immortal and omnipotent!

would succeed in making a more useful one.  This, indeed, they offered to accomplish, provided the present Statue were preliminarily destroyed; but as they were well assured that this offer would never be accepted, it was generally treated by those who re
f
used it as a braggadocio.  There were many also who, though they in general greatly admired and respected the present Statue, affected to believe that, though the execution was wonderful, and the interior machinery indeed far beyond the powers of the pres
e
nt age, nevertheless the design was in many parts somewhat rude, and the figure altogether far from being well-proportioned.  Some thought the head too big, some too small; some that the body was disproportionately little; others, on the contrary, that it
 
was so much too large that it had the appearance of being dropsical; others maintained that the legs were too weak for the support of the whole, and that they should be rendered more important and prominent members of the figure; while, on the contrary, t
here were yet others who cried out that really these members were already so extravagantly huge, so coarse, and so ungenteel, that they quite marred the general effect of a beautiful piece of sculpture.

\faauto\ls13\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\f1\cgrid0 The same differences existed about the com
parative excellence of the three metals and the portions of the body which they respectively formed.  Some admired the gold, and maintained that if it were not for the head the Statue would be utterly useless; others preferred the silver, and would assert
 
that the body, which contained all the machinery, must clearly be the most precious portion; while a third party triumphantly argued that the iron legs which supported both body and head must surely be the most valuable part, since without them the Statue
 
must fall.  The first party advised that in all future reparations gold only should be introduced; and the other parties, of course, recommended with equal zeal their own favourite metals.  It is observable, however, that if, under these circumstances, th
e
 iron race chanced to fail in carrying their point, they invariably voted for gold in preference to silver.  But the most contradictory opinions, perhaps, were those which were occasioned by the instruments with which the Statue was armed and supported.  
S
ome affected to be so frightened by the mere sight of the brandished sword, although it never moved, that they pretended it was dangerous to live even under the same sky with it; while others, treating very lightly the terrors of this warlike instrument, 
w
ould observe that much more was really to be apprehended from the remarkable strength and thickness of the calm and peace-inspiring crosier; and that as long as the Government was supported by this huge pastoral staff nothing could prevail against it; tha
t
 it could dare all things, and even stand without the help of its legs.  All these various opinions at least proved that, although the present might not be the most miraculous Statue that could possibly be created, it was nevertheless quite impossible eve
r to form one which would please all parties.

 empty and his resources utterly exhausted.  He requested the assistance of the most wealthy and the most generous of nations; and he offered them as security for their advances his gold and silver mines, which, for the breadth of their veins and the rich

Here was a pretty business for the Best and Wisest!  At first the Managers behaved in a manner the most undiplomatic, and quite lost their temper; they raved, they stormed, they contradicted each other, they contradicted themselves, and swore that Sir 
Bombastes' head should answer for it.  Then they subsided into sulkiness, and at length, beginning to suspect that the fault might ultimately attach only to themselves, they got frightened, and held frequent consultations with pale visages and quivering l
i

t
lemen determined to adopt the conqueror, whom they were at first weak enough to disclaim, then vile enough to bully, and finally forced to reward.  The Statue accordingly whispered a most elaborate panegyric on Furioso, which was of course duly delivered.
 
 The Admiral, who was neither a coward nor a fool, was made ridiculous by being described as the greatest commander that ever existed; one whom Nature, in a gracious freak, had made to shame us little men; a happy compound of the piety of Noah, the patrio
t
ism of Themistocles, the skill of Columbus, and the courage of Nelson; and his exploit styled the most glorious and unrivalled victory that was ever achieved, even by the Vraibleusians!  Honours were decreed in profusion, a general illumination ordered fo

Secretary told Popanilla that this was the famous Centaur Chiron; that his Horseship, having wearied of his ardent locality in the constellations, had descended some years back to the island of Vraibleusia; that he had commanded the armies of the nation i
n
 all the great wars, and had gained every battle in which he had ever been engaged.  Chiron was no less skilful, he said, in civil than in military affairs; but the Vraibleusians, being very jealous of allowing themselves to be governed by their warriors,
 the Centaur had lately been out of employ.  While the Secretary was giving him this information Popanilla perceived that the great Chiron was attacking the combatants on both sides.  The tutor of Achilles, Hercules, and \'c6
neas, of course, soon succeeded in 
kicking them all out, and constituted himself chief and sole Manager of the Statue.  Some grumbled at this autocratic conduct 'upon principle,' but they were chiefly connections of the expelled.  The great majority, wearied with public squabbles occasione
d
 by private ends, rejoiced to see the public interest entrusted to an individual who had a reputation to lose.  Intelligence of the appointment of the Centaur was speedily diffused throughout the island, and produced great and general satisfaction.  There
 were a few, indeed, impartial personages, who had no great taste for Centaurs in civil capacities, from an apprehension that, if he could not succeed in persuading them by his eloquence, his Grace might chance to use his heels.

gh the proprietor did not permit a single private entrance.  The enthusiasm was universal, and only twelve persons were killed.  The Private Secretary told Popanilla, with an air of great complacency, that the Vraibleusian theatres were the largest in the
 
world.  Popanilla had little doubt of the truth of this information, as a long time elapsed before he could even discover the stage.  He observed that every person in the theatre carried a long black glass, which he kept perpetually fixed to his eye.  To

The play was by the most famous dramatist that Vraibleusia ever produced; and certainly, when his Excellency witnessed the first scenes, it was easier to imagine that he was once more in his own sunset Isle of Fa
ntaisie than in the railroad state of Vraibleusia: but, unfortunately, this evening the principal characters and scenes were omitted, to make room for a moving panorama, which lasted some hours, of the chief and most recent Vraibleusian victories.  The au
d
ience fought their battles o'er again with great fervour.  During the play one of the inferior actors was supposed to have saluted a female chorus-singer with an ardour which was more than theatrical, and every lady in the house immediately fainted; becau
s
e, as the eternal Secretary told Popanilla, the Vraibleusians are the most modest and most moral nation in the world.  The male part of the audience insisted, in indignant terms, that the offending performer should immediately be dismissed.  In a few minu
t
es he appeared upon the stage to make a most humble apology for an offence which he was not conscious of having committed; but the most moral and the most modest of nations was implacable, and the wretch was expelled.  Having a large family dependent upon
 his exertions, the actor, according to a custom prevalent in Vraibleusia, went immediately and drowned himself in the nearest river.  Then the ballet commenced.

It was soon discovered that, without taking into consideration the average annual advantages which would necessarily spring from their new connection, the profits which must accrue upon the present expedition alone had alrea
dy doubled the capital of the island.  Everybody in Vraibleusia had either made a fortune, or laid the foundation of one.  The penniless had become prosperous, and the principal merchants and manufacturers, having realised large capitals, retired from bus
i
ness.  But the colossal fortunes were made by the gentlemen who had assisted the administration in raising the price of the public funds and in managing the issues of the pink shells.  The effect of this immense increase of the national wealth and of this
 
creation of new and powerful classes of society was speedily felt.  Great moves to the westward were perpetual, and a variety of sumptuous squares and streets were immediately run up in that chosen land.  Butlers were at a premium; coach-makers never slep
t
; card-engravers, having exhausted copper, had recourse to steel; and the demand for arms at the Heralds' College was so great that even the mystical genius of Garter was exhausted, and hostile meetings were commenced between the junior members of some an
c
ient families, to whom the same crest had been unwittingly apportioned; but, the seconds interfering, they discovered themselves to be relations.  All the eldest sons were immediately to get into Parliament, and all the younger ones as quickly into the Gu
ards; and the simple Fantaisian Envoy, who had the peculiar felicity of taking everything }{\i\f1\cgrid0 au pied du lettre}{\f1\cgrid0 
, made a calculation that, if these arrangements were duly effected, in a short time the Vraibleusian representatives would exceed the Vraibleusian re
presented; and that there would be at least three officers in the Vraibleusian guards to every private.  Judging from the beards and mustachios which now abounded, this great result was near at hand.  With the snub nose which is the characteristic of the 
millionaires, these appendages produce a pleasing effect.

tare if he chanced to elevate his voice, or presumed to ruffle the placidity of the social calm by addressing his fellow-creatures with teeth unparted.  Excellence was never to be recognised, but only disparaged with a look: an opinion or a sentiment, and

when the tide went down; and was so listless, abstracted, and absent, during the rest of their conversation, that it soon ceased, and they speedily parted.

, for spelling the newspaper was quite delicious to one who had so recently learned to read, he found that they spoke of nothing but of the discovery of a new island, information of which had been received by the Government only the preceding night.  The 
F
antaisian Ambassador turned quite pale, and for the first time in his life experienced the passion of jealousy, the green-eyed monster, so called from only being experienced by green-horns.  Already the prominent state he represented seemed to retire to t
h
e background.  He did not doubt that the Vraibleusians were the most capricious as well as the most commercial nation in the world.  His reign was evidently over.  The new island would send forth a Prince still more popular.  His allowance of pink shells 
w
ould be gradually reduced, and finally withdrawn.  His doubts, also, as to the success of the recent expedition to Fantaisie began to revive.  His rising reminiscences of his native land, which, with the joint assistance of popularity and philosophy, he h
ad hitherto succeeded in stifling, were indeed awkward.  He could not conceive his mistress with a page and a poodle.  He feared much that the cargo was not well assorted.  Popanilla determined to inquire after his canoe.

Although his Excellency had been in the highest state of astonishment daring his whole mission to Vraibleusia, it must be confessed, now that he understood his companion's question of yesterday, he particularly stared.  His wonder was not d
ecreased in the evening, when the 'Government Gazette' appeared.  It contained an order for the immediate fortification of the new island by the most skilful engineers, without estimates.  A strong garrison was instantly embarked.  A Governor, and a Deput

to be off the next week.  It is only due to the characters of courtiers, who are so often reproached with ingratitude to their patrons, to record that the Private Secretary, in the most delicate manner, placed at the disposal of his former employer, the M

A tradition runs, that while they were committing these abominations a ship, one of the first ships that had ever touched at the island, arrived at the present port of Hubbabub, then a spacious and shipless bay.  
The master of the vessel, on being brought before the King (for the story I am recording happened long before the construction of the miraculous Statue), presented, with his right hand, to his Majesty, a small pyramidal substance of a golden hue, which se
e
med to spring out of green and purple leaves.  His Majesty did not exactly understand the intention of this ceremony; but of course, like a true legitimate, construed it into a symbol of homage.  No sooner had the King brought the unknown substance near t
o
 his eyes, with the intention of scrutinising its nature, than the fragrance was so delightful that by mistake he applied it to his mouth.  The King, only took one mouthful, and then, with a cry of rapture, instantly handed the delicacy to his favourite, 
w
ho, to the great mortification of the Secretary of State, finished it.  The stranger, however, immediately supplied the surrounding courtiers from a basket which was slung on his left arm; and no sooner had they all tasted his gift than they fell upon the
i
r knees to worship him, vowing that the distributor of such delight must be more than man.  If this avowal be considered absurd and extraordinary in this present age of philosophy, we must not forget to make due allowance for the palates of individuals wh

 had suffered so severely from their late indiscretions that such excesses were not likely again to occur.  People began to discover that it was not quite so easy a thing as they had imagined for every man to be his own Fruiterer; and that gardening was a
 
craft which, like others, required great study, long practice, and early experience.  Unable to supply themselves, the majority became the victims of quack traders.  They sickened of spongy apricots, and foxy pears, and withered plums, and blighted apples
,
 and tasteless berries.  They at length suspected that a nation might fare better if its race of fruiterers were overseen and supported by the State, if their skill and their market were alike secured.  Although, no longer being tempted to suffer from a s
u
rfeit, the health of the Islanders had consequently recovered, this was, after all, but a negative blessing, and they sadly missed a luxury once so reasonable and so refreshing.  They sighed for an established fruit and a protected race of cultivators.  B
ut the stout soldier was so sworn an enemy to any Government Fruit, and so decided an admirer of the least delightful, that the people, having no desire of being forced to cat crab-apples, only longed for more delicious food in silence.

to discover a natural deficiency not only in all other fruits, but even in the finest pine-apples.  Fruit, they maintain, should never be eaten in the state in which Nature yields it to man; and they consequently are indefatigable in prevailing upon the l

were broken.  He entered, and his landlord immediately presented him with his bill.  As the landlord was pressing, and as Popanilla wished for an opportunity of showing his confidence in Skindeep's friendship, he requested him to pay the amount.  Skindeep
 sent a messenger immediately to his banker, deeming an ambassador almost as good security as a nation, which we all know to be the very best.

e had never seen one in the whole course of his life, nor in all probability had any one in the whole Court.  He explained to Popanilla, that originally this animal greatly abounded in Vraibleusia; that the present Court, the highest and most ancient in t
h
e kingdom, had then been instituted for tile punishment of all those who molested or injured that splendid animal.  The species, his lordship continued, had been long extinct; but the Vraibleusians, duly reverencing the institutions of their ancestors, ha
d
 never presumed to abrogate the authority of the Camelopard Court, or invest any other with equal privileges.  Therefore, his lordship added, in order to try you in this Court for a modern offence of high treason, you must first be introduced by fiction o
f law as a stealer of Camelopards, and then being }{\i\f1\cgrid0 in pr\'e6senti regio}{\f1\cgrid0

naed against him, and the evidence was conclusive.  Skindeep, who was brought up by a warrant from the King's Bench, proved the fact of Popanilla's landing; and that he had given himself out as a political exile, the victim of a tyrant, a corrupt aristocr
acy, and a misguided people.  But, either from a secret feeling towards his former friend or from his aversion to answer questions, this evidence was on the whole not very satisfactory.

hose deceptive and glowing statements were alone sufficient to ensure Popanilla's fate.  It was in vain that the author avowed that he had never written a line of his own book.  This only made his imposture more evident.  The little philosopher with whom 
h
e had conversed at Lady Spirituelle's, and who, being a friend of Flummery Flam, had now obtained a place under Government, invented the most condemning evidence.  The Marquess of Moustache sent in a state paper, desiring to be excused from giving evidenc

, on account of the delicate situation in which he had been placed with regard to the prisoner; but he referred them to his former Private Secretary, who, he had no doubt, would afford every information.  Accordingly, the President of Fort Jobation, who h

 against the prisoner, they were bound to give him the advantage of every reasonable doubt.  The foreman was about to deliver the verdict, when a trumpet sounded, and a Government messenger ran breathless into Court.  Presenting a scroll to the presiding 
g
enius, he informed him that a remarkably able young man, recently appointed one of the Managers of the Statue, in consequence of the inconvenience which the public sustained from the innumerable quantity of edicts of the Statue at present in force, had la
st night consolidated them all into this single act, which, to render its operation still more simple, was gifted with a retrospective power for the last half century.

onsolidator, compared to whom, he said, Justinian was a country attorney.  Observing, however, that the crime of high treason had been accidentally omitted in the consolidated legislation of Vraibleusia, he directed the jury to find the prisoner 'not guil
ty.'  As in Vraibleusia the law believes every man's character to be perfectly pure until a jury of twelve persons finds the reverse, Popanilla was kicked out of court, amid the hootings of the mob, without a stain upon his reputation.

too artificial a state; that a people may both think too much and do too much.  All here exists in a state of exaggeration.  The nation itself professes to be in a situation in which it is impossible for any nation ever to be naturally placed.  To maintai

amined.  When it was his turn to come forward he began to tell his story from the beginning, and would certainly have got to the lock of hair had not the President enjoined silence.  Popanilla was informed that the last Emigration-squadron was about to sa
